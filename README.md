# sqlalchemy-challenge

In this challenge, I am tasked with planning a trip to Honolulu, Hawaii. I execute a cilmate analysis on the area in two parts. 
The first part is to analyze and explore the climate data. I use Python and SQLAlchemy to gather data on the past 12 months of precipitation in the area. I also take a look at the frequency of daily observed temperatures over a year. 
The second part requires the creation of a climate app. I designed a Flask API to display the precipitation over the last year, list of stations the data was observed from, the temperatures from the most active station, and the minimum, average, and maximum temperature for any range of dates.
